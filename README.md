# About DDMJC 


DDMJC is an online literature sharing and exchange event initiated by the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) interest group. 

Its purpose is to communicate and learn about DDM and related models with students and colleagues both domestically and internationally through online means. 

The event primarily focuses on 
- the basic knowledge of the drift-diffusion model and related research, - the application of DDM in decision-making tasks, code and its implementation, mathematical principles, and so on. 
- otherwise, discussions on cognitive modeling and psychological methods are also encouraged.


The event has received strong support from COSN (Chinese Open Science Network) and CCPN (Chinese Computational Psychiatry Network).
